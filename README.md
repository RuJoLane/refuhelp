PURPOSE

The purpose of this site is to provide essential information to refugees new to Chester. In terms of accessibility, design and UX, this meant it must be simple to navigate for those who may speak little English. I did this by - 

*adding a translate tool in the nav bar with a high contrast button and universally recognisable 'translate' icon. Please note that for the purpose of this project the button directs Google Translate. Ideally this button would auto translate the page.

*Selecting a clean, simple font which is available in several languages and similar to printed typeface (Sono), as the landing page features English, Arabic, Farsi and Tigrinya text.

*Selecting high contrast but simple colours for the font and background.

*Using images for context.

LIBRARIES USED

*I built the responsive layout, nav bar and footer using Bootstrap 4.3.1

*I used Google Fonts to import Sono and Rosarivo via CSS

*I used icons from font awesome.


DESGIN / UX

* Although I approached the design / UX as 'mobile first', I found that I struggled to centre the content for viewing on a small breakpoint. 

*I took care to align and balance images, headings and paragraphs, and be consistent with the use of bold font for important information and headings. 

* I aimed for simplicity to keep the site as accessible as possible.

I used colorhunt.co to find a base for a blue / teal colour scheme. Research suggested that humanitarian websites often use blue to represent calm, this is apparent on major refugee websites rush as https://www.unhcr.org/ and https://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/. My aim was for my colour palette to echo sites such as these.

TROUBLE SHOOTING

I used Angela Wu's full stack dev course videos from Udemy to learn Flexbox and enhance UX knowledge.

I used Chat GPT in a very measured way. I would use it to debug a specific problem if something was not working as expected. I did not ask it write code from scratch for me, although I did ask for a couple of specific examples of how to do things in CSS. I then applied this myself to my code.
